## 📌 **Project Overview**  
This project predicts house prices using a trained **KNN model**. The application is built using:  
- **Frontend**: React (to create an interactive UI)  
- **Backend**: Flask (for handling API requests and serving predictions)  
- **Deployment**: Vercel (for both frontend and backend)  

---

## 🚀 **Features**  
✔️ User-friendly interface to input house details 📊  
✔️ Flask API that serves real-time predictions 📡  
✔️ Machine Learning model (KNN) for accurate predictions 🧠  
✔️ Fully deployed on **Vercel** 🌐  

---

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**  
### **Frontend**:  
- React.js  
- Axios (for API requests)  
- Vercel (for deployment)  

### **Backend**:  
- Python (Flask)  
- Scikit-Learn (for KNN model)  
- Pandas & NumPy (for data processing)  
- Flask-CORS (for handling cross-origin requests)  
- Vercel (for deployment)

## 💡 **Learnings & Challenges**  
### ✅ **Learnings**  
🔹 Building a complete **MERN-like** full-stack project with Flask & React  
🔹 Training & deploying a **KNN model** for real-world use cases  
🔹 Handling **frontend-backend communication** using REST API  
🔹 Deploying full-stack applications on **Vercel**  

### ❗ **Challenges & Solutions**  
⚠ **Backend Deployment Issues** → Fixed by correctly configuring `vercel.json`  
⚠ **CORS Errors** → Solved by adding `Flask-CORS`  
⚠ **Frontend not connecting to Backend** → Ensured the correct API base URL
